#BizCardX: Extracting Business Card Data with OCR

A solution, which is capable of reading info of a business card &amp; save it to database for further use.

Task is to develop a Streamlit application that allows users to
upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using
easyOCR. The extracted information should include it's info such as the company name, card holder
name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state,
pin code etc. The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).
In addition, the application should allow users to save the extracted information into
a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database should be
able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.

Approach:
1. Technical requirements: Python, Streamlit,
easyOCR, and a database management system like MongoDB, SQLite or MySQL.
2. Design the user interface: Created a simple and intuitive user interface using
Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business
card image and extracting its information. 
3. Implement the image processing and OCR: Used easyOCR to extract the
relevant information from the uploaded business card image. 
4. Display the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted,
displayed it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI. 
5. Implement database integration: Used MongoDB management system 
to store the extracted information along with the uploaded
business card image. 
6. Test the application: Tested the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as
expected.
